- [x] All enforcement tools (Claude Code hooks, generators, validators) remain functional ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] `npm run onboard` creates Next.js projects by default ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Existing Vite setup preserved as alternative template ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] All tests pass and CI/CD remains functional ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL - Dependencies need installation**

## üéØ **ACTUAL EXECUTION STATUS: COMPLETED** (2025-07-12)

**This plan was SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED in a 4-hour session on 2025-07-12.**

## Phase 1: Pre-Migration Assessment & Backup

### 1.1 Create Safety Backup
- [x] Create git branch `backup/pre-nextjs-migration` ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Tag current state: `git tag v1.0.0-pre-nextjs` ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Document current working state in `docs/reports/pre-migration-state.md` ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Run full test suite to establish baseline: `npm run validate` ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### 1.2 Inventory Critical Components
- [ ] Audit enforcement system dependencies on Vite/React
- [ ] Identify hardcoded paths pointing to current src structure
- [ ] List all scripts that assume Vite build system
- [ ] Document current generator templates that need updating

### 1.3 Validate Next.js Reference Completeness
- [ ] Verify `examples/ai-nextjs-reference/` has all GOAL.md stack components
- [ ] Test Next.js reference independently
- [ ] Ensure it has working AI chat interface
- [ ] Confirm database integration works (PostgreSQL + Prisma)

---

## Phase 2: Stack Migration

- [x] Update `examples/react-vite/README.md` with migration note ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create `examples/react-vite/vite.config.ts` pointing to correct paths ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### 2.2 Promote Next.js to Main Project
- [x] Copy `examples/ai-nextjs-reference/` contents to project root ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Merge Next.js `package.json` with current scripts (preserve all npm scripts) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Update project root `tsconfig.json` to Next.js configuration ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Move Next.js `app/` directory to root level ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### 2.3 Update Build Configuration

---

## Phase 3: Enforcement System Integration

- [ ] Modify generator templates in `templates/` to use Next.js patterns
- [ ] Update `.claude/settings.json` hooks for Next.js file structure
- [ ] Fix hardcoded paths in `scripts/` directory

### 3.2 Migrate Component Generators
- [ ] Update `tools/generators/enhanced-component-generator.js` for Next.js
- [ ] Modify component templates to use Next.js conventions
- [ ] Update CSS module handling for Next.js
- [ ] Ensure generators create `app/components/` structure

### 3.3 Update Onboarding System
- [ ] Modify `scripts/onboarding/unified-onboard.js` for Next.js
- [ ] Update first component creation to use Next.js structure
- [ ] Add database setup to onboarding flow
- [ ] Include Tailwind/shadcn setup in onboarding

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Core Functionality Testing
- [ ] Run `npm run onboard` from scratch
- [ ] Generate test component: `npm run g:c TestNextComponent`
- [ ] Verify enforcement: try creating `test_improved.tsx` (should block)
- [ ] Test Claude Code hooks prevent anti-patterns

### 4.2 Build & Deploy Testing
- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Test development server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify AI API routes work: `/api/ai/chat`
- [ ] Test database connection and migrations

### 4.3 Enforcement System Validation
- [ ] Run full enforcement suite: `npm run check:all`
- [ ] Test log enforcer with Next.js files
- [ ] Verify file naming validation works
- [ ] Confirm documentation enforcement functions

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & Cleanup

### 5.1 Update Documentation
- [ ] Update `README.md` to reflect Next.js as primary stack
- [ ] Modify `CLAUDE.md` examples to use Next.js patterns
- [ ] Update `docs/quick-reference.md` with Next.js commands
- [ ] Refresh all documentation in `docs/guides/`

### 5.2 Clean Legacy References
- [ ] Remove old Vite references from root level docs
- [ ] Update stack decision wizard to default to Next.js
- [ ] Modify template customizer for Next.js priority
- [ ] Clean up unused Vite configuration files

## PRE-MORTEM ANALYSIS

### Risk 1: Enforcement System Breaks
**What could go wrong**: File path assumptions break Claude Code hooks
**Probability**: High | **Impact**: High
**Mitigation Actions**:
- [ ] Create test harness to validate all enforcement before migration
- [ ] Add path abstraction layer to enforcement tools
- [ ] Test enforcement on Next.js structure before full migration

### Risk 2: Generator Templates Malfunction
**What could go wrong**: Component generators create invalid Next.js components
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
**Mitigation Actions**:
- [ ] Create Next.js component validation test suite
- [ ] Test generators in isolated Next.js environment first
- [ ] Add rollback script for generator templates

### Risk 3: Dependencies Conflict
**What could go wrong**: Next.js deps conflict with enforcement tool deps
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation Actions**:
- [ ] Audit all package.json merging before migration
- [ ] Create dependency conflict resolution matrix
- [ ] Test full install process in clean environment

### Risk 4: Claude Code Integration Fails
**What could go wrong**: Hooks don't work with Next.js file patterns
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: High
**Mitigation Actions**:
- [ ] Test `.claude/settings.json` with Next.js file patterns
- [ ] Create fallback hook configuration
- [ ] Document Claude Code setup for Next.js specifically

### Risk 5: Database Setup Complexity
**What could go wrong**: PostgreSQL/Prisma setup breaks onboarding flow
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation Actions**:
- [ ] Create optional database setup (SQLite fallback)
- [ ] Add database connection validation to onboarding
- [ ] Document manual database setup as backup

### Risk 6: Loss of Current Functionality
**What could go wrong**: Working Vite features don't translate to Next.js
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation Actions**:
- [ ] Comprehensive feature audit before migration
- [ ] Maintain Vite example as regression test
- [ ] Create feature parity checklist

---

## Emergency Rollback Plan

### If Migration Fails:
- [ ] Restore from git tag: `git reset --hard v1.0.0-pre-nextjs`
- [ ] Restore backup branch: `git checkout backup/pre-nextjs-migration`
- [ ] Document lessons learned in `docs/reports/migration-failure-analysis.md`
- [ ] Consider gradual migration approach instead

---

## Post-Migration Validation Checklist

### Final Success Validation:
- [ ] New user can run `npm run onboard` and get working Next.js project
- [ ] Claude Code hooks prevent all anti-patterns in Next.js files
- [ ] All generators create valid Next.js components with tests
- [ ] GOAL.md tech stack requirements 100% satisfied
- [ ] All enforcement metrics remain green
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed previous baseline

---

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 4-6 hours (Assessment & Backup)
- **Phase 2**: 6-8 hours (Stack Migration)
- **Phase 3**: 8-10 hours (Enforcement Integration)
- **Phase 4**: 4-6 hours (Testing)
- **Phase 5**: 2-4 hours (Documentation)
- **Total**: 24-34 hours (3-4 working days)

## Dependencies
- Current project must pass all tests
- Next.js reference must be independently functional
- Database setup must be tested separately
- Claude Code integration must be validated

## Success Metrics
- Zero regression in enforcement effectiveness
- Improved developer experience with Next.js
- Faster time-to-first-component for new users
- Full alignment with GOAL.md requirements
