# AI Patterns Hooks

Hooks that enforce AI-specific patterns and prevent common AI development mistakes.

## Purpose

These hooks focus on maintaining clean AI development patterns by:

- Preventing duplicate file creation (\_improved, \_v2, \_enhanced)
- Validating AI context efficiency and preventing pollution
- Enforcing proper streaming patterns for AI responses

## Hooks in this category

- `prevent-improved-files.js` - Blocks creation of \_improved, \_v2, \_enhanced files
- `context-validator.js` - Validates context efficiency and prevents pollution
- `streaming-pattern-enforcer.js` - Enforces proper streaming patterns

## Priority

Critical to High - These hooks prevent fundamental AI development anti-patterns that can break the development workflow.
