# Config Enforcer Implementation Plan

## Current Status: **CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE** ✅

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-12

## Overview

Implementation plan for a configuration file enforcer that validates and maintains consistency across project configuration files. This enforcer will integrate with the existing ProjectTemplate enforcement system to ensure configuration standards are automatically maintained.

**Current State**: The core config enforcer is implemented and functional, validating 11 config files in ~12ms. All planned validators are working, Claude hooks are integrated, and comprehensive documentation exists.

## Goals

- **Consistency**: Ensure all config files follow project standards
- **Validation**: Catch configuration errors before they cause issues
- **Automation**: Integrate with existing enforcement workflows
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple configuration file types and formats
- **Developer Experience**: Provide clear feedback and auto-fixes where possible

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

## Pre-Mortem Analysis

### Potential Failure Points Identified

#### 1. **Configuration Complexity Explosion**
**Risk**: Different projects have vastly different config needs, leading to overly complex schema

**Prevention Actions Added to Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 2.1: Start with common, well-defined configs (package.json, tsconfig.json) before expanding
- [ ] Phase 5.1: Implement configuration profiles instead of one-size-fits-all approach
- [ ] Phase 1.2: Design schema to be extensible but start minimal

#### 2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
**Risk**: Config validation becomes slow, especially for large projects with many config files

**Prevention Actions Added to Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 5.3: Implement caching strategy from the beginning
- [ ] Phase 5.3: Add file-change detection to avoid re-validating unchanged configs
- [ ] Phase 6.2: Include performance testing in test suite

#### 3. **Integration Conflicts**
**Risk**: Config enforcer conflicts with existing tools (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)

**Prevention Actions Added to Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 2.1: Research and integrate with existing tools rather than replacing them
- [ ] Phase 4.1: Add configuration options to disable specific validations
- [ ] Phase 6.1: Document integration patterns and potential conflicts

#### 4. **Auto-Fix Data Loss**
**Risk**: Auto-fix functionality corrupts or loses important configuration data

**Prevention Actions Added to Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 3.1: Implement backup/rollback mechanism for all auto-fixes
- [ ] Phase 6.2: Extensive testing of auto-fix with real-world config files
- [ ] Phase 4.2: Always provide dry-run mode for all fix operations

#### 5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues**
**Risk**: Config validation works differently on different operating systems

**Prevention Actions Added to Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 1.3: Use cross-platform file handling patterns from existing enforcers
- [ ] Phase 6.2: Test on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Phase 2.3: Handle line ending differences explicitly

#### 6. **Developer Workflow Disruption**
**Risk**: Config enforcer becomes too restrictive, slowing down development

**Prevention Actions Added to Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 1.2: Implement graduated enforcement levels like existing system
- [ ] Phase 4.1: Start with WARNING level by default, allow teams to opt into stricter modes
- [ ] Phase 6.1: Provide clear override mechanisms for legitimate exceptions

#### 7. **Maintainability Burden**
**Risk**: Config enforcer becomes difficult to maintain as config standards evolve

**Prevention Actions Added to Plan**:
- [ ] Phase 1.1: Use plugin-based architecture for easy extension
- [ ] Phase 6.1: Document how to add new validators and rules
- [ ] Phase 5.1: Make rule definitions data-driven rather than hard-coded
