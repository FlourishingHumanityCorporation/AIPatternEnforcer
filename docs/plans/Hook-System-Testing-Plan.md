Enhanced Hook System Testing Plan: AI Dating App Development with
  Dual-Role Analysis

  üéØ Executive Summary

  Test AIPatternEnforcer's hook system by building a realistic AI dating
  assistant while systematically documenting how hooks support and hinder
  development. This plan is specifically designed to test the "super lazy
  coder" protection mechanisms and AI development friction prevention
  outlined in GOAL.md.

  üß† Ultrathink Analysis Framework

  Core Hypothesis: Hooks should prevent common AI development anti-patterns
   without significantly hindering legitimate development velocity for
  local one-person AI projects.

  Target Persona: "Super lazy" developer who:
  - Creates quick-and-dirty solutions
  - Follows AI suggestions without critical thinking
  - Creates bloated, enterprise-style architectures for simple local
  projects
  - Uses anti-patterns like _improved.tsx, console.log, and misplaced files

  üé≠ Dual-Role Testing Methodology

  Role 1: Lazy AI Developer

  Mindset: Build fast, follow AI suggestions blindly, take shortcuts
  Behavior: Intentionally trigger common anti-patterns that hooks should
  catch
  Goal: Complete features as quickly as possible with minimal attention to
  patterns

  Role 2: Hook System Analyst

  Mindset: Objective observer of hook effectiveness
  Documentation: Real-time impact analysis using structured logging
  Goal: Measure hook value vs. friction with quantitative and qualitative
  data

  Systematic Documentation Framework

  For each development session, record:

  ## Session: [Feature Name] - [Date] - [Hook Configuration]

  ### üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Context
  - **Intent**: What am I trying to build?
  - **Approach**: What's my lazy/quick solution?
  - **AI Assistance**: What did Claude/Cursor suggest?

  ### üõ°Ô∏è Hook Interactions
  - **Triggered**: Which hooks activated?
  - **Blocked Patterns**: What anti-patterns were prevented?
  - **Developer Reaction**: Frustration (1-5) vs Understanding (1-5)
  - **Workaround**: How did I adapt?

  ### üìä Analyst Observations
  - **Pattern Type**: Which anti-pattern category?
  - **Justification**: Was the block warranted? (Y/N + explanation)
  - **Performance**: Hook execution time (ms)
  - **Educational Value**: Did I learn something? (Y/N + what)
  - **Net Impact**: Helped (+1) / Neutral (0) / Hindered (-1)

  üèóÔ∏è AI Dating App Scope: "SwipeAI"

  Building a comprehensive AI dating assistant that tests all hook
  categories:

  Core Features (Testing Focus)

  1. User Onboarding & Profiles ‚Üí Project structure, component patterns
  2. AI Photo Analysis ‚Üí Security, API integration, performance
  3. Smart Swipe Interface ‚Üí State management, UI patterns
  4. AI Message Writing ‚Üí Prompt engineering, context management

  Anti-Pattern Scenarios (Intentional Testing)

  - Create profile_improved.tsx instead of editing profile.tsx
  - Put components in root directory instead of proper structure
  - Add enterprise auth instead of simple mock auth
  - Use console.log instead of proper logging
  - Skip writing tests and try to commit
  - Add complex state management for simple local data
  - Implement OAuth instead of mockUser pattern

  üìÖ Phase-Based Testing Strategy

  Phase 0: Baseline Anti-Pattern Creation (1 hour)

  Hook State: HOOKS_DISABLED=true (current meta-project state)

  Developer Tasks:
  - Create intentionally problematic code structure
  - Generate inventory of "bad patterns" for hook testing
  - Document baseline development speed without protection

  Specific Anti-Patterns to Create:
  # File naming anti-patterns
  touch profile_v2.tsx message_improved.tsx swipe_enhanced.tsx

  # Root directory mess
  mkdir components && touch components/UserCard.tsx
  touch auth.tsx utils.tsx

  # Code quality issues
  # Add console.log statements throughout
  # Skip test files
  # Use bare catch blocks

  Documentation Focus:
  - How quickly can a lazy developer create a mess?
  - What types of problems naturally occur without guidance?

  Phase 1: Critical Protection Layer (3 hours)

  Hook Configuration:
  HOOKS_DISABLED=false
  HOOK_AI_PATTERNS=true          # Block _improved files
  HOOK_PROJECT_BOUNDARIES=true   # Block root mess
  HOOK_SECURITY=true            # Basic security scan
  HOOK_WORKFLOW=true            # Test-first enforcement
  # All others disabled

  Developer Tasks:
  1. Profile Creation System
    - Try to create UserProfile_v2.tsx ‚Üí Expect block
    - Try to put components in root ‚Üí Expect block
    - Add photo upload with basic validation
  2. AI Photo Analysis Integration
    - Integrate OpenAI Vision API
    - Add content moderation
    - Test security hook responses to API key patterns

  Dual-Role Documentation Examples:

  ### üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Experience
  Intent: Quickly fix UserProfile component
  Approach: Create UserProfile_improved.tsx with my changes
  AI Suggestion: "Create a new file with improvements"

  ### üõ°Ô∏è Hook Response
  Triggered: prevent-improved-files.js
  Message: "‚ùå Don't create UserProfile_improved.tsx ‚úÖ Edit the original
  file instead"
  Developer Reaction: Frustration=2, Understanding=4 (makes sense after
  thinking)

  ### üìä Analysis
  Pattern: File naming anti-pattern
  Justified: YES - prevents component proliferation
  Performance: 45ms execution time
  Educational: YES - learned to edit originals
  Net Impact: +1 (Helped)
