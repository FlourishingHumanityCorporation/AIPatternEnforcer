# Claude Code Hooks Completion Plan

## Matter-of-Fact Status Assessment

**Current State: 6 working hooks implemented out of planned scope, significant work remains**

I implemented 6 new Claude Code hooks beyond the existing baseline, but this work is **incomplete and not ready for handoff** due to several critical issues.

## What Actually Works Right Now

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working Hooks
1. `token-economics-guardian.js` - Warns about expensive AI operations (gpt-4, loops)
2. `performance-budget-keeper.js` - Detects memory-intensive patterns 
3. `streaming-pattern-enforcer.js` - Basic streaming validation
4. `code-bloat-detector.js` - File complexity analysis
5. `import-janitor.js` - Import analysis (does NOT modify files)
6. `vector-db-hygiene.js` - **BROKEN** (needs debugging)

**Tests**: Manual hook testing works, but unit test coverage is incomplete.

## Critical Problems Blocking Completion

### üö® Problem 1: Documentation Corruption
- Multiple key files show "(no content)" in system
- `claude-code-hooks-expansion-plan.md` may be corrupted  
- `hooks-expansion-handoff-summary.md` may be corrupted
- **Impact**: Cannot assess original scope or update progress accurately

### üö® Problem 2: Hook Registration Incomplete  
- 6 hooks implemented but registration in `.claude/settings.json` is inconsistent
- Some hooks may not be loaded by Claude Code in actual usage
- **Impact**: Hooks may not actually run during Claude Code operations

### üö® Problem 3: Import Janitor Non-Functional
- Hook analyzes imports but **does not modify files**
- Violates core GOAL.md requirement for "super lazy coder" automatic cleanup
- **Impact**: Core value proposition not delivered

### üö® Problem 4: Vector DB Hook Broken
- Vector hygiene hook fails on simple test input
- **Impact**: Critical AI stack validation missing

### üö® Problem 5: Test Coverage Gaps
- No unit tests for 4 of the 6 new hooks
- Integration testing incomplete
- **Impact**: Cannot verify reliability or catch regressions

## GOAL.md Alignment Assessment

**Goal**: "Assume the coder is super lazy and can't detect when AI is doing bad coding pattern and always ends up with a bloated mess"

**Current Alignment**: 
- ‚úÖ Prevents expensive AI operations (token-economics)
- ‚úÖ Detects code bloat patterns (code-bloat-detector)  
- ‚úÖ Warns about performance issues (performance-budget)
- ‚ùå **FAILS**: Does not automatically clean up imports (lazy coder requirement)
- ‚ùå **FAILS**: Vector DB validation broken (AI stack requirement)
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: No guarantee hooks actually run in Claude Code

**Stack Alignment**:
- ‚úÖ Supports Next.js patterns
- ‚úÖ Supports AI development (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE**: PostgreSQL + pgvector validation broken
- ‚úÖ Excludes enterprise features

## High-Impact Next Steps to Complete

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (2-3 hours)

#### Step 1: Fix Vector DB Hook (30 minutes)
```bash
# Debug and fix vector-db-hygiene.js
echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"/test.sql","content":"CREATE TABLE docs (embedding vector[512]);"}}' | node tools/hooks/vector-db-hygiene.js

# Expected: Should block non-standard dimensions
# Actual: Currently broken - fix syntax/logic errors
```

#### Step 2: Make Import Janitor Functional (45 minutes)
```bash
# Current: import-janitor.js only analyzes
# Required: Must actually modify files to remove unused imports
# Location: tools/hooks/import-janitor.js line ~200-250

# Test after fix:
echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"/tmp/test.js","content":"import unused from \"lib\";\nconst used = 1;"}}' | node tools/hooks/import-janitor.js
# Should: Modify file to remove unused import
```

#### Step 3: Verify Hook Registration (30 minutes)
```bash
# Check .claude/settings.json has all 6 hooks properly registered
# Test each hook loads without errors
# Verify PreToolUse vs PostToolUse placement is correct
```

#### Step 4: Create Missing Unit Tests (45 minutes)
```bash
# Create: tools/hooks/__tests__/vector-db-hygiene.test.js
# Create: tools/hooks/__tests__/streaming-pattern.test.js  
# Create: tools/hooks/__tests__/code-bloat.test.js
# Create: tools/hooks/__tests__/performance-budget.test.js
# Run: npm test -- tools/hooks/__tests__/
```

### Phase 2: Documentation Accuracy (30 minutes)

#### Step 5: Fix Documentation Corruption
```bash
# Recover or recreate key planning documents
# Update status to reflect actual 6/12 complete (not 6/15)
# Align all status numbers across documents
```

### Phase 3: Integration Validation (30 minutes)

#### Step 6: End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Verify hooks actually run during Claude Code Write/Edit operations
# Test hook timeout handling and fail-open behavior
# Confirm no performance issues or blocking problems
```

## Success Criteria for Completion

**Functional Requirements**:
- [ ] All 6 hooks work correctly in manual testing
- [ ] import-janitor actually modifies files (removes unused imports)
- [ ] vector-db-hygiene blocks non-standard dimensions  
- [ ] All hooks properly registered in .claude/settings.json
- [ ] Unit tests exist and pass for all 6 hooks

**GOAL.md Alignment**:
- [ ] "Super lazy coder" automatic cleanup works (import-janitor)
- [ ] AI stack validation complete (vector-db working)
- [ ] No enterprise features added
- [ ] Supports local AI development patterns

**Documentation Accuracy**:
- [ ] All plan documents reflect actual status
- [ ] Consistent completion metrics across documents
- [ ] Clear handoff instructions for remaining work

## Realistic Timeline

**Total time to complete**: 4-5 hours focused work

**Week 1 (Critical)**: 
- Day 1: Fix vector-db hook and import-janitor functionality (2 hours)
- Day 2: Complete unit tests and verify registration (2 hours) 
- Day 3: Documentation fixes and integration testing (1 hour)

## Handoff for Your Inattentive Friend

**What I did**: Implemented 6 Claude Code hooks for AI development friction prevention
**What works**: Token economics, performance budgets, code bloat detection, streaming validation
**What's broken**: Vector DB validation, import cleanup doesn't modify files  
**What's missing**: Unit tests, proper documentation, verification hooks actually run

**To continue**: Start with fixing vector-db-hygiene.js syntax errors, then make import-janitor actually modify files. Don't trust the documentation - test everything manually first.

**Time investment**: This represents about 8 hours of work so far, needs 4-5 more hours to be properly complete.

**Bottom line**: Solid foundation but core functionality still broken. Don't oversell the progress.
