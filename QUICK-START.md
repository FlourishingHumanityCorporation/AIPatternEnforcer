## ⚡ Highly Quick Start (2 minutes)

**For experienced developers who want immediate value:**

```bash
# 1. Quick setup (installs dependencies + basic config)
npm run setup:quick

# 2. Generate your first component  
npm run g:c TestComponent

# 3. See what was created
ls src/components/TestComponent/

# 4. Start development
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Guided Setup (5 minutes)

**For first-time users who want full configuration:**

```bash
# Interactive wizard with AI tool setup + enforcement
npm run setup:guided

# Explore all generators with examples
npm run demo:generators

# Generate components with comprehensive features
npm run g:c UserProfile
```

**Success checkpoint**: ✅ If you see 4-5 files created and dev server runs, you're ready to build.

## 🧭 Choose Your Learning Path

### 🟢 New to AI Development (15 min)
**Goal**: Understand what AI can do for your development workflow

**Start here**: [AI Assistant Setup](docs/guides/ai-development/ai-assistant-setup.md) → [Beginner

Docs](docs/architecture/)

**You'll build**: Custom generators, team adoption strategies, advanced automation

## 🎯 What is ProjectTemplate?

**Solves Real AI Development Friction**:
- ❌ AI forgets project rules → ✅ Persistent context via CLAUDE.md
- ❌ Inconsistent code generation → ✅ Enforced patterns and generators  
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities → ✅ Built-in security scanning
- ❌ Review burden from large AI PRs → ✅ Atomic change guidelines

## 🆘 Having Issues?

### Quick Fixes
- **AI tools not working**: [AI Assistant Setup](docs/guides/ai-development/ai-assistant-setup.md#common-setup-issues)
- **Command not found**: `npm install` then retry
- **Port already in use**: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
- **Tests failing**: [Common Issues](CLAUDE.md#common-issues)
