## For Developer Communities (Discord/Slack)

### Initial Post

```text
ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone! We're looking for 5-10 developers to test ProjectTemplate - a new system that reduces friction when
using AI coding assistants.

**What we're testing:** Whether our code generators, enforcement rules, and project structure actually save 50%+ time on
common tasks.

**Requirements:**
â€¢ Use AI tools (Cursor/Claude/Copilot) regularly
â€¢ Work with React/TypeScript
â€¢ Available for 4-week pilot
â€¢ Can provide feedback on your experience

**You'll get:** Early access, direct support, productivity metrics, and influence on the roadmap.

Time commitment: ~2-3 hours total over 4 weeks.

Interested? Check out details and apply: [link]

Questions? DM me or ask here!
```

### Follow-up Message (3 days later)

```text
Quick update on the ProjectTemplate pilot - we've had effective interest and still have 3 spots available!

If you're tired of:
â€¢ AI generating `component_v2_final_FINAL.js` files
â€¢ Manually organizing generated code
â€¢ Explaining project structure to AI repeatedly

This pilot might be for you. Takes ~5 min to apply: [link]

Closing applications on [DATE].
```

## For LinkedIn/Professional Networks

```text
Looking for developers to test a new AI development workflow system.

I'm recruiting 5-10 developers for a 4-week pilot program testing ProjectTemplate - a system designed to reduce friction
when using AI coding assistants.

If you:
â€¢ Use Cursor, Claude, or Copilot regularly
â€¢ Work with React and TypeScript
â€¢ Want to measure and improve your productivity
â€¢ Can commit ~2-3 hours over 4 weeks

You'll get early access, productivity metrics, and direct influence on the product roadmap.

Details and application: [link]

Please share with developers who might be interested!
```

## For Local Meetups

### Lightning Talk Pitch (2 minutes)

```text
Hi everyone! Quick announcement - we're running a pilot program for ProjectTemplate, a system that makes AI coding
assistants work better with your projects.

The problem: AI tools generate effective code but terrible file names, don't follow project patterns, and require
constant
context.

Our solution: Smart generators, automated enforcement, and optimized project structure.

We need 5-10 developers to test if it really saves the 50% development time we're claiming.

Requirements: You use AI tools, work with React/TypeScript, and can provide feedback over 4 weeks.

There's a flyer with QR code by the door, or find me after for details. Thanks!
```

## For Direct Outreach (Email/DM)

### Personalized Message Template

```text
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're active in [AI tool community/use AI tools/work with React]. I'm recruiting developers for a pilot
program that might interest you.

We're testing ProjectTemplate - a system that reduces friction when using AI coding assistants. Think: no more _v2_final
files, automatic code organization, and 50% faster component creation.

The pilot runs 4 weeks, requires ~2-3 hours total commitment, and you'll get:
â€¢ Early access to the system
â€¢ Quantified productivity metrics
â€¢ Direct support from our team
â€¢ Influence on feature priorities

Would you be interested in participating or know someone who might be?
