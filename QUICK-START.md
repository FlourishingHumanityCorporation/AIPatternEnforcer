## ⚡ Super Quick Start (2 minutes)

**For experienced developers who want immediate value:**

```bash
# 1. Verify setup works
npm install && npm test

# 2. Generate your first component  
npm run g:c TestComponent

# 3. See what was created
ls src/components/TestComponent/

# 4. Start development
npm run dev
```

**Success checkpoint**: ✅ If you see 4-5 files created and dev server runs, you're ready to build.
