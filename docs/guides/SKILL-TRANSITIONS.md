## 🟢→🟡 Beginner to Intermediate

### Ready to Level Up?

**You're ready for Intermediate when:**
- [ ] Component generation (`npm run g:c`) works reliably
- [ ] You understand how CLAUDE.md affects AI behavior
- [ ] AI setup verification passes: `npm run setup:verify-ai`
- [ ] You've successfully generated and modified 3+ components

### Bridge: What Changes at Intermediate Level

**New Capabilities You'll Gain:**
- **AI Tool Optimization** - Configure for your specific workflow
- **Template Customization** - Modify generators for your patterns
- **Enforcement Understanding** - Know why rules exist and how to modify them
- **Systematic Debugging** - Use Arrow-Chain RCA methodology

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Setup** (10 min)
   ```bash
   # Run the guided setup wizard
   npm run setup:guided
   ```

2. **Test Advanced AI Configuration** (5 min)
   - For Cursor: Test custom `.cursorrules` modifications
   - For Claude: Use `npm run context` with specific file paths
   - For Copilot: Configure workspace-specific settings

3. **Understand Enforcement** (10 min)
   ```bash
   # See what enforcement prevents
   npm run enforcement:status
   
   # Try to create a "bad" file (will be blocked)
   touch user_service_improved.js
   
   # Understand the rules
   npm run check:all
   ```

### Success Checkpoint

**You've successfully transitioned when:**
- [ ] You can explain why enforcement rules exist
- [ ] You've customized at least one generator template
- [ ] You can debug AI issues using systematic methodology
- [ ] You're comfortable modifying AI tool configurations

### Common Transition Challenges

**Challenge**: "Too many options, don't know where to start"
**Solution**: Follow the Intermediate Path step-by-step in
[USER-JOURNEY.md](../../USER-JOURNEY.md#-intermediate-path-ai-workflow-optimizer)

**Challenge**: "AI setup feels complex"
**Solution**: Use verification: `npm run setup:verify-ai` to confirm each step

**Challenge**: "Don't understand why rules exist"
**Solution**: Read [FRICTION-MAPPING.md](../../FRICTION-MAPPING.md) to see problems rules solve

## 🟡→🔴 Intermediate to Expert

### Ready for Expert Level?

**You're ready for Expert when:**
- [ ] You've customized generators for your specific patterns
- [ ] You understand the complete enforcement system
- [ ] You can debug AI issues systematically
- [ ] You've successfully configured multiple AI tools

### Bridge: What Changes at Expert Level

**New Responsibilities You'll Have:**
- **Architecture Design** - Design AI-assisted development processes
- **Team Leadership** - Guide others in AI development adoption
- **System Contribution** - Improve the template for everyone
- **Advanced Automation** - Build custom tools and integrations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Study Complete Architecture** (20 min)
   ```bash
   # Read the full methodology
   cat FULL-GUIDE.md
   
   # Examine enforcement architecture
   cat tools/enforcement/enforcement-config.js
   
   # Review generator architecture
   cat tools/generators/enhanced-component-generator.js
   ```

2. **Create Custom Generator** (30 min)
   ```bash
   # Study generator structure
   ls tools/generators/
   
   # Create new generator type
   mkdir templates/api-endpoint/
   # Build custom templates for your architecture
   ```

3. **Advanced Customization** (20 min)
   - Customize enforcement rules for your team
   - Set up advanced AI context loading
   - Create custom prompt libraries

### Success Checkpoint

**You've successfully transitioned when:**
- [ ] You can create custom generators from scratch
- [ ] You've contributed an improvement back to the template
- [ ] You can guide others through the Beginner→Intermediate transition
- [ ] You understand how to architect AI development processes

## 🔴→🟢 Expert to Beginner (Onboarding Others)

### Teaching Others Effectively

**When onboarding someone new:**

1. **Start with their context** - What AI tools have they used?
2. **Use the verification system** - `npm run setup:verify-ai` gives them confidence
3. **Show immediate value** - Generate their first component together
4. **Explain the "why"** - Don't just show what, explain why rules exist

### Common Mentoring Mistakes

❌ **Don't**: Overwhelm with all features at once
✅ **Do**: Start with Super Quick Start in [QUICK-START.md](../../QUICK-START.md)

❌ **Don't**: Skip setup verification
✅ **Do**: Always run `npm run setup:verify-ai` together

❌ **Don't**: Assume they understand AI friction
✅ **Do**: Reference specific problems from [FRICTION-MAPPING.md](../../FRICTION-MAPPING.md)

## ⬇️ Stepping Down (Reducing Complexity)

### When You Feel Overwhelmed

**If Expert path feels too complex:**
- Return to [Intermediate Path](../../USER-JOURNEY.md#-intermediate-path-ai-workflow-optimizer)
- Focus on practical application over theory
- Use verification checkpoints to rebuild confidence

**If Intermediate path feels too complex:**
- Return to [Beginner Path](../../USER-JOURNEY.md#-beginner-path-ai-development-starter)
- Focus on getting basic AI generation working
- Build confidence with simple, successful interactions

### Recovery Strategy

1. **Simplify your environment**
   ```bash
   # Reset to basic configuration
   npm run setup:basic
   ```

2. **Focus on one success**
   ```bash
   # Just get component generation working
   npm run g:c SimpleComponent
   ```

3. **Rebuild gradually**
   - Master one AI tool before adding others
   - Add complexity only after previous step is solid
