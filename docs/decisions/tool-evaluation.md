## Context and Problem Statement

We need to standardize our development tooling to ensure consistency, quality, and productivity across the team. This
includes:

- Code editor/IDE
- AI coding assistants
- Version control workflow
- CI/CD platform
- Monitoring and observability
- Error tracking

## Decision Drivers

- **Team Productivity**: Tools should make developers faster
- **AI Integration**: First-class AI assistance capabilities
- **Cost**: Both licensing and operational costs
- **Learning Curve**: How quickly can team adopt?
- **Integration**: Tools should work well together
- **Scalability**: Can grow with our needs
- **Security**: Must meet security requirements

## Tool Categories and Options

### IDE / Code Editor

1. **Cursor**
   - Pros: AI-first design, based on VS Code, great AI integration
   - Cons: Newer, smaller extension ecosystem, costs money
   - Cost: $20/month per developer
   - AI: Native AI integration

2. **VS Code + GitHub Copilot**
   - Pros: Huge ecosystem, free editor, familiar
   - Cons: AI is add-on, not native
   - Cost: Free + $10/month for Copilot
   - AI: Good but not as integrated

3. **JetBrains IDEs + AI Assistant**
   - Pros: Powerful refactoring, language-specific IDEs
   - Cons: Heavy, expensive, learning curve
   - Cost: $25-50/month per developer
   - AI: Newer AI features

### AI Coding Assistants

1. **GitHub Copilot**
   - Pros: Great code completion, integrated with GitHub
   - Cons: Limited to code completion mainly
   - Cost: $10/month individual, $19/month business

2. **Cursor's Claude Integration**
   - Pros: Full conversation, understands context better
   - Cons: Requires Cursor IDE
   - Cost: Included with Cursor

3. **Codeium**
   - Pros: Free tier available, works everywhere
   - Cons: Less powerful than alternatives
   - Cost: Free or $12/month

### Version Control Platform

1. **GitHub**
   - Pros: Industry standard, great integrations, Actions CI/CD
   - Cons: Microsoft owned (if that matters)
   - Cost: Free for public, $4/user/month for private

2. **GitLab**
   - Pros: All-in-one platform, self-hostable
   - Cons: Can be complex, slower UI
   - Cost: Free tier available, $19/user/month premium

3. **Bitbucket**
   - Pros: Integrates with Atlassian suite
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem
   - Cost: Free for small teams, $3/user/month

### CI/CD Platform

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Pros: Integrated with GitHub, good free tier
   - Cons: YAML complexity, vendor lock-in
   - Cost: 2000 free minutes/month, then usage-based

2. **CircleCI**
   - Pros: Fast, good caching, parallelization
   - Cons: Can get expensive, another tool to manage
   - Cost: 6000 free minutes/month, then usage-based

3. **Vercel**
   - Pros: Zero-config for Next.js, preview deployments
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, mainly for frontend
   - Cost: Free for hobby, $20/user/month for pro

### Error Tracking

1. **Sentry**
   - Pros: Industry leader, great integrations
   - Cons: Can get expensive with scale
   - Cost: Free for 5K errors/month, then $26/month+

2. **Rollbar**
   - Pros: Good AI for grouping errors
   - Cons: Less popular, fewer integrations
   - Cost: Free tier, then $12.50/month+

3. **LogRocket**
   - Pros: Session replay included
   - Cons: More expensive, frontend focused
   - Cost: $99/month starting

### Monitoring

1. **Datadog**
   - Pros: Comprehensive, great visualizations
   - Cons: Expensive, complex pricing
   - Cost: $15/host/month starting

2. **New Relic**
   - Pros: Good free tier, easy setup
   - Cons: UI can be overwhelming
   - Cost: Free for 100GB/month, then $0.30/GB

3. **Grafana + Prometheus**
   - Pros: Open source, powerful, free
   - Cons: Requires setup and maintenance
   - Cost: Free (self-hosted)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen tools:

### Development Environment

- **Primary IDE**: [Your choice]
- **AI Assistant**: [Your choice]
- **Rationale**: [Why this combination]

### Infrastructure

- **Version Control**: [Your choice]
- **CI/CD**: [Your choice]
- **Deployment**: [Your choice]
- **Rationale**: [Why these work together]

### Observability

- **Error Tracking**: [Your choice]
- **Monitoring**: [Your choice]
- **Logging**: [Your choice]
- **Rationale**: [Why this stack]

### Example Selection:

```text
Development:
- Cursor + Claude (optimal AI integration)
- GitHub (team already knows it)

Infrastructure:
- GitHub Actions (integrated CI/CD)
- Vercel (zero-config deployment)

Observability:
- Sentry (proven error tracking)
- Vercel Analytics (integrated)
- Axiom (affordable logging)

Total cost: ~$45/developer/month
```

### Positive Consequences

- Standardized tooling reduces context switching
- AI assistance speeds up development
- Integrated tools reduce complexity
- Good free tiers for starting out

### Negative Consequences

- Some vendor lock-in risk
- Monthly costs add up with team growth
- Need to train team on new tools

## Implementation Plan

1. **Week 1**: Set up accounts and access
2. **Week 2**: Configure integrations
3. **Week 3**: Team training sessions
4. **Week 4**: Migrate existing projects
5. **Ongoing**: Gather feedback and adjust

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll re-evaluate in 6 months based on:

- Developer satisfaction surveys
- Productivity metrics
- Cost vs value analysis
- Integration pain points
- New tools that emerge

## Budget Summary

Per developer per month:

- IDE + AI: $20-30
- Version control: $4-19
- Error tracking: $5-10 (amortized)
- Monitoring: $10-20 (amortized)
- **Total**: $40-80/developer/month

## Notes

- Prioritize tools that work well with AI assistants
- Consider tools that can grow from startup to enterprise
- Evaluate based on current needs, not future possibilities
- Keep the stack as simple as possible
