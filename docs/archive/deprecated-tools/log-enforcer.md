# Log Enforcer - DEPRECATED

## ⚠️ Tool Deprecated

**Status**: This tool has been **DEPRECATED** and removed as part of the enforcement system migration.

**Migration Date**: 2025-07-12

## Replacement

Log enforcement is now handled automatically by **Claude Code hooks**:

### New Approach: Real-time Prevention

**Hook**: `fix-console-logs.js` (automatic)
- **Location**: `tools/hooks/fix-console-logs.js`
- **Function**: Automatically converts `console.log` to `logger.info` during AI interactions
- **No manual commands needed** - works transparently

### Usage

**Before** (deprecated):
```bash
npm run check:logs    # ❌ NO LONGER EXISTS
npm run fix:logs      # ❌ NO LONGER EXISTS
```

**Now** (automatic):
- Claude Code automatically fixes console.log statements during Write/Edit operations
- No manual intervention required
- Zero friction for developers

### Example

When you write:
```javascript
console.log('Debug message');
```

The hook automatically converts it to:
```javascript
logger.info('Debug message');
```

You'll see: `✨ Auto-fixed 1 console.log → logger calls`

## Migration Information

**Why was this deprecated?**
- Manual enforcement tools caused 241,858 violations/day
- Real-time prevention via hooks eliminates the need for post-hoc correction
- Zero friction approach aligns with GOAL.md vision

**What happened to the tool?**
- `tools/enforcement/log-enforcer.js` → Deleted
- NPM scripts `check:logs`, `fix:logs` → Removed
- Functionality moved to `tools/hooks/fix-console-logs.js`
