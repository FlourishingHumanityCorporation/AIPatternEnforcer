# Hook System Status & Next Steps

## Executive Summary

**Current Reality**: The hook system is functional but over-engineered. We have 20 hooks running when documentation claims 9. Core enforcement works well, but consolidation is needed.

## Current State vs Plan Analysis

### What's Working ✅

- All 20 hooks are functional and operational
- Real-time enforcement via Claude Code hooks active
- PatternLibrary consolidation successful (90% code reduction)
- Performance-guardian fixed for nested loop detection
- End-to-end validation passed (correct block/allow behavior)
- Core anti-patterns properly blocked:
  - \_improved files ✅
  - Root directory violations ✅
  - Security vulnerabilities ✅
  - Enterprise patterns ✅
  - Complex nested loops ✅

### Critical Misalignment ⚠️

- **Documentation vs Reality**: CLAUDE.md claims "9 simple hooks" but 20 are running
- **Organization**: Hooks should be in core/, ai/, quality/ but all in flat structure
- **Consolidation**: Plan called for 18 → 9 hooks but reduction not completed
- **Root Cleanup**: Phase 1 of restructuring plan not executed

## Current Hook Inventory

### Essential Hooks (Keep - 9 total)

1. **prevent-improved-files.js** - File hygiene (critical)
2. **block-root-mess.js** - Structure enforcement (critical)
3. **security-scan.js** - Vulnerability prevention (critical)
4. **enterprise-antibody.js** - Scope enforcement (critical)
5. **performance-guardian.js** - Complexity management (recently fixed)
6. **scope-limiter.js** - Feature creep prevention (critical)
7. **mock-data-enforcer.js** - Local-only enforcement (merge with localhost-enforcer)
8. **fix-console-logs.js** - Auto-cleanup utility
9. **meta-project-guardian.js** - Infrastructure protection

### Redundant/Specialized Hooks (Remove - 11 total)

- context-validator.js (over-engineering, blocks docs)
- architecture-validator.js (too restrictive, blocks legitimate files)
- docs-enforcer.js (documentation overkill)
- localhost-enforcer.js (merge into mock-data-enforcer.js)
- api-validator.js (merge into security-scan.js)
- validate-prisma.js (too specialized)
- vector-db-hygiene.js (too specialized)
- template-integrity-validator.js (over-validation)
- import-janitor.js (cleanup can be manual)
- streaming-pattern-enforcer.js (too specific)
- test-location-enforcer.js (let developers organize)

## High-Impact Next Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Consolidation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Reduce from 20 to 9 essential hooks

**Actions**:

1. **Remove 11 redundant hooks** from .claude/settings.json
2. **Merge related functionality**:
   - localhost-enforcer.js → mock-data-enforcer.js
   - api-validator.js → security-scan.js
3. **Update CLAUDE.md** to reflect actual 9 hooks
4. **Test reduced system** to ensure core enforcement maintained

### Phase 2: Organization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Implement planned directory structure**:

```
tools/hooks/
├── core/ (prevent-improved, block-root-mess, meta-project-guardian)
├── ai/ (security-scan, enterprise-antibody, scope-limiter)
├── quality/ (performance-guardian, mock-data-enforcer, fix-console-logs)
└── lib/ (PatternLibrary, HookRunner, etc.)
```

### Phase 3: Root Directory Cleanup (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Complete original restructuring plan Phase 1**:

- Move application code to templates/
- Clean build artifacts
- Update tsconfig.json for meta-project focus

## For Next Developer

### Quick Start

1. **First Priority**: Remove context-validator.js and architecture-validator.js - they're blocking legitimate operations
2. **Key Success**: PatternLibrary approach works - use it for further consolidation
3. **Don't Trust**: CLAUDE.md documentation until consolidation complete

### Key Files

- `.claude/settings.json` - Current hook configuration (20 hooks)
- `tools/hooks/lib/PatternLibrary.js` - Successful consolidation pattern
- `docs/GOAL.md` - Immutable project requirements
- `docs/plans/restructuring_plan.md` - Original architecture plan

### Immediate Win

Comment out context-validator.js in .claude/settings.json - it's preventing docs creation without adding value.

### Long-term Vision

The system should enforce GOAL.md requirements (local AI apps, no enterprise features) without hindering rapid development. Current system works but needs streamlining to match the "copy-paste template" goal.

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Hook count: 20 → 9 essential
- ✅ Documentation aligned with reality
- ✅ Core enforcement maintained
- ✅ Development friction reduced
- ✅ GOAL.md requirements enforced

_Status: Hook system functional but requires consolidation to match intended design_
