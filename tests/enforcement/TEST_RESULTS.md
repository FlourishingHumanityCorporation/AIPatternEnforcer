## Test Suite Overview

The enforcement system has been comprehensively tested to ensure all violation detection and prevention mechanisms work
correctly.

### Test Command
```bash
npm run test:enforcement
```

## Test Results: ✅ All Tests Passed

### 1. Root Directory Enforcement
- ✅ **Detects violations**: Files not on allowlist are caught
- ✅ **Passes clean root**: No false positives with proper files
- ✅ **Script detection**: Scripts in root are flagged with proper suggestions

### 2. Banned Document Detection
- ✅ **SUMMARY files**: Files ending with SUMMARY are blocked
- ✅ **REPORT files**: Files ending with REPORT are blocked  
- ✅ **COMPLETE files**: Files ending with COMPLETE are blocked
- ✅ **Content patterns**: Detects "✅ Implementation Complete" and similar patterns
- ✅ **Clean files pass**: No false positives on regular documentation

### 3. Integration Tests
- ✅ **Combined checks**: `npm run check:all` runs all enforcement
- ✅ **Configuration**: Enforcement status properly reported

### 4. Pre-commit Hook Integration
The pre-commit hook automatically runs:
1. File naming checks (no improved/enhanced/v2)
2. Root directory checks
3. Banned document type checks

## Verification Examples

### Root Directory Violation
```bash
# Create violation
echo "test" > violation.md

# Check catches it
npm run check:root
# ❌ Root directory violations found

# Cleanup
rm violation.md
```

### Banned Document Violation
```bash
# Create banned doc
echo "# Summary" > AUDIT_SUMMARY.md

# Check catches it  
npm run check:banned-docs
# ❌ Found banned document types

# Cleanup
rm AUDIT_SUMMARY.md
```

## System Architecture

1. **Enforcement Scripts**
   - `tools/enforcement/root-file-enforcement.js`
   - `tools/enforcement/banned-document-types.js`
   - `tools/enforcement/no-improved-files.js`

2. **Pre-commit Integration**
   - `.husky/pre-commit` runs all checks
   - Blocks commits with violations

3. **Configuration**
   - `tools/enforcement/enforcement-config.js`
   - Banned docs always enforced at FULL level
   - Root violations always blocked

## Conclusion

The enforcement system successfully:
- Prevents creation of banned document types
- Maintains clean root directory
- Integrates seamlessly with git workflow
- Provides clear error messages and suggestions
- Works automatically without manual intervention
