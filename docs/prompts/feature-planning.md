# Feature Planning Prompt

I need to implement [FEATURE_NAME]. Before writing any code:

1. List all affected parts of the architecture
2. Identify potential security concerns
3. Show the data flow through the system
4. List all edge cases and error scenarios
5. Provide a file-by-file implementation plan
6. Suggest what tests to write first

Current architecture context is in @architecture.md
Follow all rules in @claude.md
