## Context and Problem Statement

We need to establish core principles that will guide all development decisions in this project to ensure consistency,
maintainability, and quality.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for consistent code quality
- AI-assisted development is becoming standard
- Security must be built-in, not added later
- Documentation often becomes outdated

## Considered Options

- No formal principles - rely on individual judgment
- Adopt existing framework principles
- Define custom principles for our context

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Define custom principles for our context", because our development workflow includes AI assistance which
requires specific considerations.

### Core Principles

1. **AI-First Development**
   - All code should be written to be easily understood by AI assistants
   - Use clear naming and avoid clever tricks
   - Document intent, not just implementation

2. **Security by Design**
   - Never commit secrets
   - Always validate inputs
   - Use principle of least privilege

3. **Documentation as Code**
   - Documentation lives with code
   - Use tools that enforce documentation
   - Keep examples executable

4. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests first when possible
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Tests should be readable as documentation

5. **Simplicity Over Cleverness**
   - Prefer boring technology
   - Optimize for readability
   - Avoid premature optimization

### Positive Consequences

- Clear guidelines for all developers
- Better AI-assisted development experience
- Reduced security vulnerabilities
- Living documentation

### Negative Consequences

- May limit use of cutting-edge patterns
- Requires discipline to maintain
