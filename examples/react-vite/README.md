This is the original Vite-based template that was used before migrating to Next.js App Router.

## Features

- ⚡️ **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- ⚛️ **React 19** - Latest React features
- 🔷 **TypeScript** - Type safety
- 🧪 **Vitest** - Fast unit testing
- 🎯 **ESLint** - Code linting
- 💖 **Prettier** - Code formatting

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/          # React components
├── utils/              # Utility functions
├── styles/             # CSS files
├── App.tsx             # Main app component
└── main.tsx            # Entry point
```

## Migration Note

This example preserves the original Vite-based structure from AIPatternEnforcer. The main project has been migrated to Next.js App Router for better AI development patterns.

For new projects, use the Next.js App Router template in the main project directory.
