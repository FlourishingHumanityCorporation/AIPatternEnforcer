# Project Rules for AI Assistant

## Context
This document defines our API patterns and rules

## You MUST follow these rules:

1. Always use RESTful naming conventions: GET /users, POST /users, GET /users/:id
2. Return consistent error responses with code, message, and details fields

## Project-Specific Patterns:

### Error Response Format
```typescript
interface ApiError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details?: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp: string;
}
```
