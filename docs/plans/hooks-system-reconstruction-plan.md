# Hooks System Reconstruction Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for reconstructing the hooks system to eliminate false positives while maintaining effective enforcement.

## Issue Identified

The architecture-validator.js hook was blocking documentation files that mentioned AI API calls, treating them as if they were code files that needed error handling.

## Root Cause

The `validateAiIntegration` function checked for AI patterns in ALL content without distinguishing between:

- Code files (.js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx) that actually make AI API calls
- Documentation files (.md) that only reference AI concepts

## Solution Implemented

Modified the `validateAiIntegration` function to:

1. Check file extensions before applying AI validation
2. Only require error handling for actual code files
3. Skip AI validation for documentation and config files

## Testing

This document itself serves as a test - it mentions AI API calls, Claude, OpenAI, and streaming patterns, but should not be blocked since it's a .md file.
