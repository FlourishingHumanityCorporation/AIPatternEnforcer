- [ ] Complete basic setup without errors
- [ ] Generate first component using AI tools
- [ ] Understand how to ask for help
- [ ] Feel confident to continue exploring

### Your Journey Steps

#### Step 1: Quick Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Follow the streamlined setup
npm install
npm run setup:hooks
```
**Success check**: âœ… No red error messages

#### Step 2: First AI-Generated Component (5 minutes)
```bash
# Generate your first component
npm run g:c WelcomeCard

# See what was created
ls src/components/WelcomeCard/
```
**Success check**: âœ… See 4-5 files created (TypeScript, test, CSS, etc.)

**ðŸ’¡ If this fails**: See [Component Generation Issues](FRICTION-MAPPING.md#21-hallucination--fabrication) for solutions

#### Step 3: Understanding AI Context (3 minutes)
```bash
# Load AI context to see how it works
npm run context
```
**Success check**: âœ… Understand this gives AI tools better context about your project

**ðŸ’¡ If AI forgets project rules**: This solves [Context
Decay](FRICTION-MAPPING.md#11-goldfish-memory-context-window-constraints)

#### Step 4: Verify Everything Works (2 minutes)
```bash
# Run tests to ensure quality
npm test

# Quick validation
npm run validate
```
**Success check**: âœ… All tests pass, no major warnings

### What You've Learned
- How to generate consistent, tested components
- Basic AI context management
- Quality validation workflows
- Foundation for more advanced features

### Next Steps Decision
- **Continue Learning**: Move to [Intermediate Path](#-intermediate-path-ai-workflow-optimizer) 
- **Start Building**: Use [Generator Reference](docs/guides/generators/) for your project
- **Get Help**: Check [Common Issues](CLAUDE.md#common-issues) or [AI Assistant Setup](docs/guides/ai-development/ai-assistant-setup.md)

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Path: "AI Workflow Optimizer"

**Goal**: Master AI-assisted development patterns and customize for your needs

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Configure AI tools for optimal performance
- [ ] Understand enforcement system and why it helps
- [ ] Customize generators for your specific needs
- [ ] Apply systematic debugging methodology
- [ ] Build confidence in AI development patterns

### Your Journey Steps

#### Step 1: Enhanced Setup (10 minutes)
```bash
# Complete setup with customization
npm run setup:guided  # Interactive wizard

# Install AI development extensions
code --install-extension extensions/projecttemplate-assistant/projecttemplate-assistant-0.1.0.vsix
```
**Success check**: âœ… Interactive setup completed, VS Code extension working

#### Step 2: AI Tool Mastery (15 minutes)

**Configure Your Primary AI Tool:**

**For Cursor Users:**
- Open `.cursorrules` file
- Review the AI instructions
- Test with `Cmd+K` prompt: "Create a user login form component"

**For Claude Users:**
```bash
# Load optimized context
npm run context -- src/components/

# Test prompt: "Based on this project context, create a user profile component with TypeScript, tests, and proper accessibility"
```

**Success check**: âœ… AI tool generates code following project patterns

**ðŸ’¡ Common issues**: 
- [AI ignores project rules](FRICTION-MAPPING.md#12-flawed-retrieval-rag-unreliability)
- [Interface feels clunky](FRICTION-MAPPING.md#61-interface-clutter)
- [Shortcuts conflict](FRICTION-MAPPING.md#62-keyboard-shortcut-conflicts)

#### Step 3: Understanding Enforcement (10 minutes)
```bash
# See current enforcement settings
npm run enforcement:status

# Try creating a "bad" file to see enforcement
touch user_service_improved.js  # This should be blocked

# Check enforcement rules
npm run check:all
```
**Success check**: âœ… Understand how enforcement prevents common mistakes

#### Step 4: Generator Customization (15 minutes)
```bash
# Explore generator templates
ls templates/component/

# Create a custom component type
npm run g:c DataTable --template data

# Understand the patterns
cat templates/component/{{name}}.tsx.hbs
```
**Success check**: âœ… Able to customize generated code patterns

#### Step 5: Systematic Debugging (10 minutes)
```bash
# Learn debug context capture
npm run debug:snapshot

# Practice Arrow-Chain RCA methodology
# Read: FULL-GUIDE.md > Arrow-Chain Root-Cause Analysis
```
**Success check**: âœ… Understand systematic approach to debugging

**ðŸ’¡ Why this matters**: Solves [Black-Box Debugging](FRICTION-MAPPING.md#51-black-box-debugging) where AI can't see
runtime state

### What You've Learned
