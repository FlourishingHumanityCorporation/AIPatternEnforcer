# Cleanup Hooks

Hooks that automatically clean up and improve code quality during development.

## Purpose

These hooks focus on maintaining clean code by:

- Fixing console.log statements to use proper logging
- Cleaning up unused imports
- Enforcing documentation standards and organization

## Hooks in this category

- `fix-console-logs.js` - Auto-converts console.log to proper logging
- `import-janitor.js` - Cleans up unused imports
- `docs-enforcer.js` - Enforces documentation standards and organization

## Priority

Low to Medium - These hooks improve code quality but don't block development.
