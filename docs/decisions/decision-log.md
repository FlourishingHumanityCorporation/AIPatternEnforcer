## 2024 Decisions

### 2024-MM-DD - Example: Adopt TypeScript Strict Mode

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Tech Lead, Senior Developers  
**Category**: Architecture

**Decision**: Enable TypeScript strict mode for all new code

**Context**: We were seeing runtime errors that could have been caught at compile time. Strict mode catches many common bugs.

**Consequences**:

- All new files must pass strict checks
- Gradually migrate old files
- Slightly slower initial development
- Fewer runtime errors

**Related**: [ADR-004-typescript-strict.md]

### 2024-MM-DD - Example: Use Zustand for State Management

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Frontend Team  
**Category**: Architecture

**Decision**: Replace Redux with Zustand for client state management

**Context**: Redux boilerplate was slowing development. Team found Zustand simpler with TypeScript.

**Consequences**:

- New features use Zustand
- Migrate Redux stores over 3 months
- Smaller bundle size
- Better TypeScript inference

**Related**: [Issue #234], [PR #245]

### 2024-MM-DD - Example: Adopt Cursor as Primary IDE

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Entire Development Team  
**Category**: Tools

**Decision**: Standardize on Cursor for AI-assisted development

**Context**: Team survey showed 80% already using Cursor. AI integration significantly boosts productivity.

**Consequences**:

- Company licenses for all developers
- Migrate VS Code settings
- Team training session scheduled
- Update onboarding docs

**Related**: [Tool Evaluation Doc]

### 2024-MM-DD - Example: Implement Feature Flags

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Tech Lead, Product Manager  
**Category**: Architecture

**Decision**: Use LaunchDarkly for feature flag management

**Context**: Need to decouple deployments from releases. Want gradual rollouts and A/B testing capability.

**Consequences**:

- $200/month for team tier
- All new features behind flags
- Can test in production safely
- Faster iteration cycles

**Related**: [ADR-005-feature-flags.md]

### 2024-MM-DD - Example: PostgreSQL as Primary Database

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Backend Team, CTO  
**Category**: Architecture

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL for all new services, migrate from MongoDB

**Context**: Need ACID compliance for financial data. PostgreSQL JSONB gives flexibility we used MongoDB for.

**Consequences**:

- New services use PostgreSQL
- 6-month migration plan for existing data
- Team training on SQL/PostgreSQL
- Better data consistency

**Related**: [Migration Plan Doc]

### 2024-MM-DD - Example: Mandatory PR Reviews

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Entire Team  
**Category**: Process

**Decision**: Require 1 approval for all PRs, 2 for critical paths

**Context**: Several bugs slipped through that review would have caught. Team agrees reviews are valuable learning opportunity.

**Consequences**:

- No direct pushes to main
- ~2 hour average review time
- Better code quality
- Knowledge sharing improved

**Related**: [Contributing Guidelines]

### 2024-MM-DD - Example: Node.js 20 Upgrade

**Status**: Proposed  
**Deciders**: TBD  
**Category**: Architecture

**Decision**: Upgrade all services to Node.js 20

**Context**: Node.js 18 approaching end of maintenance. Version 20 has performance improvements we want.

**Consequences**:

- Test all services with Node.js 20
- Update CI/CD pipelines
- Potential breaking changes to handle
- ~15% performance improvement expected

**Related**: [Upgrade Plan]

## 2023 Decisions

### 2023-12-01 - Example: Adopt React Query

**Status**: Superseded by TanStack Query  
**Deciders**: Frontend Team  
**Category**: Architecture

**Decision**: Use React Query for server state management

**Context**: Complex data fetching logic scattered across components. Need centralized caching and sync.

**Consequences**:

- Cleaner components
- Automatic background refetching
- Optimistic updates easier
- Learning curve for team

**Related**: [PR #123]
