leverage unique advantages like persistent memory and real-time validation.

**Target Outcomes**:
- 90%+ compliance rate within first session
- Sub-15-minute onboarding time
- Consistent behavior across all Claude Code instances
- Self-improving system through validation feedback loops

- Roll out to broader development team

### **Success Criteria for "Over the Finish Line"**
- [ ] 5+ successful real-user onboarding completions
- [ ] <15 minute average completion time validated with real data  
- [ ] >90% completion rate achieved
- [ ] Multi-instance consistency verified
- [ ] Production deployment ready

**Reality Check**: The system is functionally complete but needs real-world validation to be truly "finished"
