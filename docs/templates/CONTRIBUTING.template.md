## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+ or yarn 1.22+
- Git

### Local Development

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your values

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linter

# Run specific test file
npm test -- user.test.ts
```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

We use ESLint and Prettier. Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-format.

Key conventions:

- Use functional components and hooks
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use TypeScript types, not `any`
- Named exports for components

Example:

```typescript
// Good
export const UserProfile: FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ user }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  // Component logic

  return <div>...</div>;
};

// Bad
export default function UserProfile(props: any) {
  let loading = false;
  // ...
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use CSS Modules or styled-components
- Follow BEM naming convention
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS variables for theming

### File Naming

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Types: PascalCase with `.types.ts` (e.g., `User.types.ts`)
- Tests: Same as file with `.test.ts` (e.g., `formatDate.test.ts`)

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint

docs: update installation instructions

refactor(utils): simplify date formatting logic
```
