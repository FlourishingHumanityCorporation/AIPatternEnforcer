# Archived Duplicated Templates

These templates were archived during the AIPatternEnforcer architecture optimization on `date`.

## What Was Archived

### 1. ai-chat-interface/
- **Reason**: Functionality consolidated into `templates/next-ai-unified/`
- **Features Migrated**: Chat interface, streaming, multi-provider support
- **Status**: All functionality preserved in unified template

### 2. ai-document-processor/
- **Reason**: Functionality consolidated into `templates/next-ai-unified/`
- **Features Migrated**: OCR processing, document analysis, file upload
- **Status**: All functionality preserved in unified template

### 3. nextjs-app-router/
- **Reason**: Functionality consolidated into `templates/next-ai-unified/`
- **Features Migrated**: Basic Next.js structure, AI integration
- **Status**: All functionality preserved in unified template

## Migration Summary

- **Before**: 3 separate templates with 70% code duplication
- **After**: 1 unified template with modular features
- **Result**: Easier maintenance, consistent patterns, reduced complexity

## Access Archived Code

If you need to reference the original implementations:
```bash
# Browse archived templates
ls archive/duplicated-templates/

# Copy specific features if needed
cp archive/duplicated-templates/ai-chat-interface/components/chat/* templates/next-ai-unified/components/ai/
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

To restore archived templates:
```bash
mv archive/duplicated-templates/* templates/
```

**Note**: The unified template is recommended for all new development.
