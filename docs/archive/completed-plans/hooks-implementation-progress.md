# Hooks Implementation Progress & Next Steps

**Current Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Document Purpose**: Track actual implementation of enforcement-hooks-migration-plan.md

## Executive Summary for Handoff

**What We Did**: Created a comprehensive plan to replace 39 complex enforcement tools with 5 simple Claude Code hooks. The plan is complete and aligned with project goals.

**What We Didn't Do**: Actually implement any of the hooks. The violations are still growing (241,858 documentation violations/day).

**Why It Matters**: Every day without hooks, AI creates more `_improved` files, more console.logs, and more architectural violations that compound into technical debt.

## Current State (Honest Assessment)

### ✅ What's Done
1. **Migration Plan Created** - Complete, aligned with GOAL.md
2. **Hook Examples Written** - 5 essential hooks documented with code
3. **Success Metrics Defined** - Clear targets (<100 violations/day)

### ❌ What's NOT Done  
1. **Zero Hooks Actually Implemented** - Still using old system
2. **39 Complex Tools Still Running** - Creating 241K+ violations/day
3. **No Real Testing** - Examples are theoretical, not proven
4. **No Measurement Baseline** - Don't know current hook performance

### 📊 Current Violation Metrics
```
Documentation: 241,858/day (and growing)
Import violations: 8,541/day
Config violations: 139/day
File naming: 4/day (only thing working)
```

## High-Impact Next Steps (Do These First!)

### Step 1: Create Minimal Hook Infrastructure (2 hours)
**Why First**: Can't test hooks without basic setup

- [ ] Create `tools/hooks/` directory
- [ ] Create test file: `tools/hooks/test-hook.js`
```javascript
// Super simple test
console.log('Hook received:', JSON.stringify(process.argv[2] || {}));
process.exit(0);
```
- [ ] Add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "node tools/hooks/test-hook.js"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```
- [ ] Test with Claude Code: `claude "write test.txt"`
- [ ] Verify hook executes

### Step 2: Implement ONE Working Hook (1 hour)
**Why**: Prove the concept works before doing all 5

- [ ] Create `tools/hooks/no-improved-files.js`:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const input = JSON.parse(process.argv[2] || '{}');
const filePath = input.tool_input?.file_path || '';

if (/_improved|_enhanced|_v2/.test(filePath)) {
  console.error('🚫 Stop creating new versions! Edit the original file.');
  process.exit(2); // Block the operation
}
process.exit(0);
```
- [ ] Update `.claude/settings.json` to use it
- [ ] Test by trying to create `Button_improved.tsx`
- [ ] Measure violations before/after

### Step 3: Delete the Worst Offender (30 minutes)
**Why**: intelligent-documentation-assistant.js alone causes 237K violations/day

- [ ] Run `rm tools/enforcement/intelligent-documentation-assistant.js`
- [ ] Remove from package.json scripts
- [ ] Remove from all check commands
- [ ] Watch violation count drop dramatically

### Step 4: Implement Console.log Fixer (1 hour)
**Why**: Second most common AI mistake

- [ ] Create `tools/hooks/fix-console-log.js`:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const fs = require('fs');
const input = JSON.parse(process.argv[2] || '{}');
const filePath = input.tool_input?.file_path || '';

if (!filePath.match(/\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$/)) process.exit(0);

try {
  let content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
  const original = content;
  
  // Simple replacement (not AST-based for simplicity)
  content = content.replace(/console\.log/g, 'logger.info');
  
  if (content !== original) {
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, content);
    console.log(`✅ Fixed console.log in ${filePath}`);
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Fail silently - don't block work
}
process.exit(0);
```
- [ ] Add as PostToolUse hook
- [ ] Test with real file edits

### Step 5: Measure Success (30 minutes)
**Why**: Need to prove this works

- [ ] Record current violations/day
- [ ] Use hooks for 1 day of real work
- [ ] Record new violations/day
- [ ] Calculate reduction percentage
- [ ] Document in this file

## Implementation Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Hooks Break Claude Code
**Mitigation**: Test each hook individually, use timeouts, fail gracefully

### Risk 2: Performance Issues  
**Mitigation**: 3-second timeout, skip large files, async where possible

### Risk 3: Cross-Platform Issues
**Mitigation**: Use Node.js not shell scripts, test on your OS first

## Success Criteria (Be Realistic)

### Week 1 Success
- [ ] 1 hook working reliably
- [ ] 50% reduction in one violation type
- [ ] No Claude Code crashes

### Week 2 Success  
- [ ] 3 hooks working
- [ ] 75% overall violation reduction
- [ ] Delete 20+ unused tools

### Week 3 Success
- [ ] All 5 hooks stable
- [ ] <100 violations/day total
- [ ] Can copy to new project

## Handoff Notes

**For Your Cherished but Inattentive Friend:**

Hey! We made a great plan but didn't implement it yet. The good news: the plan is solid and aligned with making AI not create garbage. The bad news: we're still getting 241K violations per day.

**What you need to know:**
1. The plan is in `enforcement-hooks-migration-plan.md` - it's good, follow it
2. Start with Step 1 above - just make ONE hook work first
3. The intelligent-documentation-assistant.js is the worst offender - delete it
4. Don't overthink - these hooks should be <50 lines each
5. Success = AI stops making `_improved` files and console.logs

**Current blockers:**
- No actual implementation started
- Need to test hook infrastructure
- Need to measure baseline metrics

**Your first 2 hours:**
1. Create tools/hooks/ directory
2. Make the test hook work
3. Implement no-improved-files.js
4. Delete intelligent-documentation-assistant.js
5. Celebrate the violation count dropping

Remember: We're optimizing for lazy solo devs who just want AI to stop being stupid. Keep it simple, make it work, then stop.

## Next Document Update

Update this document after:
- [ ] First hook is working
- [ ] Violation metrics measured
- [ ] Any hook fails in real usage

**Progress**: Plan complete, implementation not started. Next updater should fill in actual results.
