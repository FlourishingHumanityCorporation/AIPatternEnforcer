# Framework Selection Decision

- Status: Template - Update for your project
- Deciders: [List team members involved]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select the primary frameworks for our application including:

- Frontend framework
- Backend framework
- Database technology
- State management solution
- Testing framework

## Decision Drivers

- **Developer Experience**: How productive will the team be?
- **Performance**: Can it meet our performance requirements?
- **Ecosystem**: Quality and availability of libraries/tools
- **Community**: Size and activity of community for support
- **Long-term Viability**: Will it be maintained for 3-5 years?
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript support quality
- **Hiring**: Can we find developers who know it?
- **AI Tool Support**: How well do AI tools understand it?

## Considered Options

### Frontend Framework

1. **React**
   - Pros: Huge ecosystem, most popular, excellent AI support
   - Cons: Requires many decisions, frequent breaking changes

2. **Vue 3**
   - Pros: Gentle learning curve, great docs, stable API
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less AI training data

3. **Angular**
   - Pros: Full framework, enterprise-ready, TypeScript-first
   - Cons: Steep learning curve, verbose, heavy

4. **SvelteKit**
   - Pros: Great performance, simpler mental model
   - Cons: Smaller community, less mature ecosystem

### Backend Framework

1. **Next.js (Full-stack)**
   - Pros: Same language front/back, great DX, Vercel deployment
   - Cons: Not ideal for complex APIs, vendor lock-in risk

2. **Express + TypeScript**
   - Pros: Mature, flexible, huge ecosystem
   - Cons: Requires many decisions, less structure

3. **Fastify**
   - Pros: High performance, TypeScript support, schema validation
   - Cons: Smaller community than Express

4. **NestJS**
   - Pros: Enterprise-ready, Angular-like structure, full-featured
   - Cons: Heavy, opinionated, learning curve

### Database

1. **PostgreSQL**
   - Pros: Feature-rich, reliable, JSONB support
   - Cons: Requires more ops knowledge

2. **MongoDB**
   - Pros: Flexible schema, easy to start
   - Cons: Eventually need schema, consistency challenges

3. **SQLite**
   - Pros: Zero ops, perfect for small apps
   - Cons: Limited concurrent writes, single machine

4. **Supabase**
   - Pros: Postgres + extras, great DX, auth included
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, costs scale with usage

### State Management (Frontend)

1. **Zustand**
   - Pros: Simple, TypeScript-friendly, small
   - Cons: Less ecosystem than Redux

2. **Redux Toolkit**
   - Pros: Mature, predictable, great DevTools
   - Cons: Boilerplate, learning curve

3. **Context + useReducer**
   - Pros: Built-in, no dependencies
   - Cons: Performance pitfalls, no DevTools

4. **TanStack Query** (for server state)
   - Pros: Purpose-built for server state, great caching
   - Cons: Additional complexity

## Decision Outcome

Chosen stack: **[Your choices here]**

Example:

- Frontend: React (familiar to team, best AI support)
- Backend: Next.js API routes + Fastify microservices
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- State: Zustand + TanStack Query
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

### Rationale

[Explain why this combination works for your specific needs]

Example rationale:
"We chose React because our team has experience and AI tools provide excellent React support. Next.js gives us SSR capabilities and easy deployment. PostgreSQL provides the reliability we need for financial data. Zustand offers simplicity without sacrificing power. This stack is boring but proven."

### Positive Consequences

- Mature ecosystem with solutions for most problems
- Easy to hire developers
- Excellent AI tool support
- Can scale from MVP to enterprise

### Negative Consequences

- Need to keep up with React ecosystem changes
- PostgreSQL requires some operational expertise
- Multiple technologies to learn and maintain

## Migration Strategy

If coming from another stack:

1. New features use new stack
2. Gradually migrate old features
3. Run both in parallel during transition
4. Complete migration within 6 months

## Review Criteria

We will reconsider these choices if:

- Performance requirements change significantly
- Team composition changes dramatically
- Better alternatives emerge and mature
- Vendor lock-in becomes concerning

## Notes

- All frameworks must have TypeScript as first-class citizen
- Prioritize frameworks with good documentation
- Consider AI tool training data availability
- Evaluate based on our specific use case, not hype
