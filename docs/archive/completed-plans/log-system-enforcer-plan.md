## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of an automated enforcement system that ensures proper logging practices across
the ProjectTemplate codebase, preventing the use of `print()` statements in production code and enforcing the use of
proper logging mechanisms.

## Goals

- Prevent `print()` statements in production code

- Provide automatic fixes where possible
- Integrate with existing enforcement infrastructure
- Support multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript)
