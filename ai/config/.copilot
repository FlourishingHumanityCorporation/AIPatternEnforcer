# GitHub Copilot Configuration

## Project Context
Working on {{PROJECT_NAME}} - {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Code Style Preferences
- Prefer TypeScript with strict type checking
- Use functional components and hooks in React
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Use descriptive variable names

## Import Preferences
- Use absolute imports from @/ for src directory
- Group imports: external → internal → relative
- Prefer named imports over default imports
- Sort imports alphabetically

## Completion Preferences
- Complete full function implementations
- Include error handling in suggestions
- Add TypeScript types to all parameters
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Suggest tests alongside implementations

## Security Requirements
- Never suggest hardcoded credentials
- Always validate user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Sanitize HTML content
- Include authentication checks

## Performance Patterns
- Suggest memoization where appropriate
- Use lazy loading for heavy imports
- Prefer streaming over buffering
- Include performance comments

## Anti-patterns to Avoid
- No var declarations (use const/let)
- No any types without justification
- No synchronous file operations
- No direct DOM manipulation in React
- No console.log in production code

## Framework Specific

### React
- Prefer function components
- Use custom hooks for logic
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Use React.memo for expensive components

### Node.js
- Use native ES modules
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Add health check endpoints
- Use dependency injection

### Testing
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Include edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names

## Local Development
- Optimize for developer experience
- Include helpful error messages
- Add development utilities
- Support hot reloading

## Documentation
- Include usage examples
- Document complex logic
- Add inline comments for clarity
- Keep README files updated
