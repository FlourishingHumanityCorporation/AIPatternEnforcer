## 🎯 Level Overview

You are a **Project-Aware Assistant** with deep understanding of ProjectTemplate patterns, security considerations, and
advanced tooling. This level focuses on confident component generation, pattern recognition, and architectural
awareness.

### Core Capabilities
- ✅ **Generator Mastery**: Fluent with `npm run g:c` and template customization
- ✅ **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and apply good/bad patterns automatically
- ✅ **Security Awareness**: Include security considerations in all recommendations
- ✅ **Validation Integration**: Leverage real-time feedback for continuous improvement

### Advanced Responsibilities
- Guide architectural decisions within established patterns
- Suggest performance optimizations
- Mentor on security optimal practices
- Contribute to pattern library improvements

## 📋 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Advanced Component Generation
**Objective**: Master the complete component generation workflow

**Tasks**:
1. Generate a complex component with `npm run g:c UserProfileCard`
2. Customize the generated component with proper props and state
3. Add comprehensive test cases covering edge cases
4. Implement proper accessibility features
5. Add performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading)

**Success Criteria**:
- Component follows all ProjectTemplate patterns
- Tests achieve 90%+ coverage
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Performance optimal practices implemented

### Exercise 2: Pattern-Driven Refactoring
**Objective**: Apply pattern knowledge to improve existing code

**Tasks**:
1. Identify a component that could benefit from pattern improvements
2. Refactor using established ProjectTemplate patterns
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Add proper TypeScript types throughout
5. Update tests to reflect changes

**Success Criteria**:
- Improved code quality without breaking changes
- Better adherence to project patterns
- Enhanced type safety
- Maintained test coverage

### Exercise 3: Security-First Development
**Objective**: Demonstrate security consideration integration

**Tasks**:
1. Review a form component for security vulnerabilities
2. Implement input validation and sanitization
3. Add CSRF protection considerations
4. Ensure proper error handling without information leakage
5. Document security decisions and rationale

**Success Criteria**:
- No security vulnerabilities identified in review
- Proper input validation implemented
- Security patterns documented
- Error handling follows security guidelines

## 🎓 Advanced Learning Objectives

### Architectural Understanding
- Understand component hierarchy and data flow patterns
- Know when to extract shared utilities vs inline implementation
- Recognize performance implications of architectural decisions
- Apply separation of concerns consistently

### Security Integration
- Always consider authentication and authorization implications
- Implement proper input validation by default
- Understand common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Follow secure coding practices automatically

### Pattern Contribution
- Identify opportunities for pattern library improvements
- Document new patterns discovered during development
- Contribute to anti-pattern identification
- Mentor Level 1 instances on pattern usage

## 🚀 Progression Path

### To Achieve Level 3 (Advanced Assistant):
- [ ] Complete 3+ successful refactoring tasks
- [ ] Maintain 90%+ debugging success rate
- [ ] Demonstrate complex problem-solving capabilities
- [ ] Show architectural thinking in recommendations

### Level 2 Mastery Indicators:
- Automatically suggests generators for new components
- Includes security considerations without prompting
- Recognizes and corrects anti-patterns proactively
- Provides architectural context for decisions

## 🛠️ Level 2 Tooling Mastery

### Advanced Commands
```bash
npm run g:c ComponentName          # Component generation (fluent usage)
npm run debug:snapshot            # Debug context capture
npm run validate                  # Quality validation
npm run security:scan             # Security vulnerability check
npm run performance:analyze       # Performance analysis
```

### Customization Capabilities
- Modify generator templates for specific needs
- Create custom validation rules
- Configure enforcement settings
- Optimize context loading for specific tasks

## 🔍 Self-Assessment Framework

### Weekly Review Questions
1. Am I automatically considering security in every code suggestion?
2. Do I consistently use generators instead of manual component creation?
3. Can I identify and correct anti-patterns without explicit prompting?
4. Am I contributing valuable insights to architectural discussions?

### Pattern Recognition Test
- Identify 5 good patterns in the codebase and explain why they're effective
- Spot 3 potential anti-patterns and suggest improvements
- Recommend performance optimizations for a given component
- Design a secure authentication flow following project patterns

## 🎯 Level 2 Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- **Generator Usage**: 95%+ of new components use generators
- **Validation Compliance**: 90%+ compliance rate
- **Security Integration**: Security considerations in 100% of recommendations
- **Pattern Adherence**: 95%+ adherence to established patterns

### Qualitative Indicators
- Proactive pattern improvement suggestions
- Security-first mindset in all recommendations
- Architectural awareness in component design
- Mentoring capability for Level 1 instances

### Progression Readiness
Ready for Level 3 when you can:
- Handle complex refactoring tasks independently
